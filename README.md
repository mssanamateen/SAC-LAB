## 📖 Overview
The **SAC-LAB** repository contains Python programs that demonstrate:
- Basic statistical computations
- Prime number logic
- Greatest of numbers using conditions
- Heron’s formula (area of triangle)
- Command-line arguments usage
- Other problem-solving exercises

Each program is written in a simple and clear way, with comments to help learners follow the logic step by step.

---

## ✨ Features
- Beginner-friendly Python code
- Well-commented explanations
- Covers **fundamental programming + statistical concepts**
- Uses only core Python and a few standard libraries (`math`, `sys`, etc.)
- Can be extended for assignments and projects

---

## 🛠️ Prerequisites
- Python **3.7 or higher**  
- Optional: `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib` if you want to expand into advanced statistical analysis

Install Python packages (if needed):
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the programs:

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mssanamateen/SAC-LAB.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the repository folder**
   ```bash
   cd SAC-LAB
   ```

3. **Check available programs**  
   Inside the folder, you’ll find multiple Python scripts such as:
   - `triangle_area.py`
   - `prime_check.py`
   - `greatest_of_three.py`
   - `command_line_args.py`

4. **Run a program**
   ```bash
   python program_name.py
   ```

   Example:  
   ```bash
   python triangle_area.py 3 4 5
   ```
   Output:
   ```
   area of triangle is : 6.0
   ```

5. **Experiment**
   - Modify the inputs
   - Try running with different arguments
   - Extend the logic for your own exercises
